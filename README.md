## Question Generation Web App

This is a simple Angular web application used to demonstrate the work of the [Question-Generation-Transformers](https://github.com/KristiyanVachev/Question-Generation-Transformers) repository. It accepts the given paragraph along with the desired number of questions and outputs each generated question with the ability to redact them (shown below). The algorithm is exposing a simple REST API using *flask* which is consumed by the web app.
